<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested a utility page to be displayed on a secondary monitor (1920x1080). The initial idea was to have several widgets like a clock, weather, news, etc. The project evolved significantly based on user feedback, leading to the removal of several widgets and the addition of others. The user also requested a standalone Mac application, which led to a complex and ultimately unsuccessful debugging process with Electron. The project has since reverted to a stable, browser-based application that runs locally.

The final set of requested widgets is: Clock, Countdown Events, To-Do List, Pomodoro Timer, Quick Notes, Shortcuts, and a Calculator.

**User's preferred language**: Italiano

**what currently exists?**
A React-based dashboard application that runs locally in a web browser. The dashboard features a grid of draggable and resizable widgets managed by . It includes a dark/light theme toggle. Data for the To-Do List and Notes widgets, as well as the widget layout, is persisted in the browser's . The project is set up on the user's local machine in a Git repository.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Replacing the problematic Spotify widget with a new Calculator widget.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should instruct the user to run the app and test the calculator's functionality using both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs (numbers, operators, Enter, Esc, Backspace).
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Verify the new Calculator Widget (P0)**
  - **Description:** The agent implemented a Calculator widget with keyboard and mouse support to replace the Spotify widget. The user needs to pull the latest changes, reset the dashboard layout to make the new widget appear, and confirm that it is present and fully functional.
  - **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Task: Create a Standalone Mac App (P2)**
  - The initial attempts to create a standalone Electron  failed due to numerous build errors (, , ). If the user still desires a native app experience instead of running  in the terminal, this task can be revisited. This would require a thorough debugging of the  configuration and the resource loading path in .

**Completed work in this session**
- **Dashboard Core:**
  - Built a responsive and resizable widget dashboard using React and .
  - Implemented a dark/light mode theme.
  - Enabled vertical scrolling to accommodate all widgets.
- **Implemented Widgets:**
  - : Displays real-time clock and date. (DONE)
  - : A functional to-do list that saves data to . (DONE)
  - : A quick notes widget that saves data to . (DONE)
  - : A functional Pomodoro timer. (DONE)
  - : A widget with quick links to external websites. (DONE)
  - : A widget to count down to a specific date/event. (DONE)
  - : A calculator with both keyboard and mouse support. (DONE)
- **Removed Widgets (per user request):**
  - Weather and News widgets (due to API key issues and user frustration).
  - System Monitor widget (could not be implemented with real-time data in a web app).
  - Calendar, Conversions, and Spotify widgets (user changed their mind).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Failed Electron App Build**
  - **Debug checklist:**
    1.  The project is now a pure frontend application, which simplifies the build. The previous backend-related error () is no longer relevant.
    2.  Re-investigate the  configuration. The error  persists even when attempting to disable  packaging. The path loading logic in  needs a robust solution that works for packaged apps.
    3.  Address dependency conflicts (like ) during the  phase of the build script, possibly by using .
  - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** The user's original goal was a true standalone application for their Mac, which would be more convenient than running a command in the terminal for each use.
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Both (the build process itself and the resulting application).
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components.
- **Layout:**  for the draggable and resizable widget grid.
- **State Persistence:** Browser  is used to save the widget layout and data for the To-Do and Notes widgets.
- **Development Environment:** The user runs the application locally using  after pulling changes from a GitHub repository.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (No database is used)

**changes in tech stack**
- The architecture was simplified from a full-stack application (React + FastAPI) to a pure frontend React application. All backend code and API calls have been removed.
- The attempt to package the application with Electron was abandoned in favor of a simpler browser-based execution model.

**All files of reference**
- : The main container for the widgets. It was last updated to remove the  and add the .
- : A new file created to provide the calculator functionality.
- : Recently modified to change  to  to enable scrolling.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The project's  directory and  likely contain unused files and dependencies from previously removed widgets (Weather, News, Spotify, etc.). These should be removed to clean up the codebase.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Communicate in Italian.**
- The project is now a **local, browser-based application only**. Do not suggest creating a standalone Electron app again unless the user explicitly requests it. The previous attempts were unsuccessful and frustrating for the user.
- The user interacts with the project via a local Git repository located at . All code changes must be pushed to the remote repository so the user can run .
- **Layout Reset:** When adding or removing widgets, the user's saved layout in  will be outdated. Remind the user to click the Reset button in the UI or manually run  in the browser console and refresh the page to see the changes.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- Multiple instructional markdown files and shell scripts were created to assist with the (failed) Electron app installation. These are now obsolete but exist in the repository (e.g., , ).

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. **User:** Requested a way to manage Spotify music directly from the dashboard.
2. **Agent:** Implemented a Spotify widget, but it had issues (syntax error, not appearing).
3. **User:** After fixes, reported that the widget only played 30-second previews.
4. **Agent:** Explained that a Spotify login is required for full playback.
5. **User:** Became frustrated with Spotify's limitations and asked for an alternative.
6. **Agent:** Suggested a Calculator widget.
7. **User:** Asked if the calculator would support keyboard input in addition to mouse clicks.
8. **Agent:** Confirmed it would support both.
9. **User:** Approved the request (si procedi).
10. **Agent:** Implemented the calculator and removed the Spotify widget.
11. **User (Pending Confirmation):** hai aggiunto la calcolatrice e tolto Spotify? (Did you add the calculator and remove Spotify?). The agent has confirmed this and provided instructions to update. The user has not yet reported back on whether the calculator works.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The Electron build process is non-functional and has been abandoned.
- **Mocked:** None. All widgets that were previously mocked have been removed. Current widgets are fully functional.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** []
- **Known regressions:** The goal of a standalone  file was not met. The project regressed to a simpler, browser-based solution.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has not cleaned up the source code by removing the component files and dependencies for the widgets that the user asked to remove (e.g., , , , etc.). This adds unnecessary bloat to the project.</analysis>
